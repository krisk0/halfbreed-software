Recipe for 64-bit 7-zip executable compiled via bionic-targeting gcc-5.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Read ../common/recipe.txt and do what it says, especially paragraph 7. Yes, 
    you need to install my bionic toolchain including gcc-5.3.0 compiler and 
    fake pthread library. No, other toolchains won't work, if they have no 
    suitable pthread.so.

2. Run ./p7zip-compile

   On success, $PORTAGE_TMPDIR/portage/app-arch/p7zip-9.38.1-r3/image/usr/lib 
    should contain 7-zip library and executables, where PORTAGE_TMPDIR is a 
    setting in your make.conf which defaults to /var/tmp .

3. Test executables locally, then install them onto your tablet (if it can run
    64-bit code). The easiest installation is pushing 7za executable as 
    /system/bin/7z .
    
   The executable should complain about missing libraries. You should copy 
    them, too.
   
   If you don't want to modify /system, copy 7z/ and 
    /usr/x86_64-linux-android/lib64/ to /data/local/7z.temp directory on your 
    64-bit Android device. To check if the compressor works, change to 
    /data/local/7z.temp and issue command
    
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./7za a 7z-works.7z lib*
    
   This command should compress some files into 7z-works.7z

// 32 bit 7-zip compiles fine but does not work. Bug-report localizing error is
//  welcome
