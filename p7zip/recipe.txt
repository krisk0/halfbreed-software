1. Read ../common/recipe.txt and do what it says.

2. Run ./p7zip-compile .

On success, $PORTAGE_TMPDIR/portage/app-arch/p7zip-9.38.1-r3/image/usr/lib should contain 7-zip library and executables, where PORTAGE_TMPDIR is a setting in your make.conf which defaults to /var/tmp .

3. Test executables locally, then install them onto your tablet. The easiest installation is pushing 7za executable as /system/bin/7z .
