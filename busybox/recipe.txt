Recipe for 32-bit busybox executable compiled via glibc-targeting gcc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you want a different version than 1.24.2 (or if your portage tree has no /busybox-1.24.2.ebuild), fix ebuild name in line 22 of ./busybox-compile

2. Create directory /usr/x86_64-linux-android/bin if it does not exist.

3. Run busybox-compile 

4. If phase 1 fails, upgrade glibc via 'emerge -q sys-libs/glibc' and goto 3.

5. On success /usr/x86_64-linux-android/bin/busybox should be created.

   Copy it into /system/bin/ of your Intel Atom Android device, make it owned 
    by root:root, chmod 555. Use different ownership or rights if you have reason.
   
   Create symbolic links for your favorite utilities:
    cd /system/bin
    for x in bzip2 cut diff egrep fgrep find lzma sort tar tee uname which xargs ; do
     ln -s busybox $x
    done
